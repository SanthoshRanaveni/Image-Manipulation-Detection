# Image-Manipulation-Detection
It is an implementation of the paper "Image Manipulation Detection using Convolutional Neural Network" from scratch as described in the paper. I used the database BOSSBASE 1.01 for this project. The manipulated images are created using using median filtering, Gaussian blurring, additive white Gaussian noise addition, and image resizing for 256x256 images that were divided into 4 equal parts of Boss Base 1.01 images.
